## What is Inventor CAM 2017?
 
Inventor CAM 2017 is an integrated CAM software that works seamlessly inside Autodesk Inventor. It allows you to rapidly turn your 3D models into machined parts directly inside Inventor, without the need to export or import files. You can create toolpaths for various machining operations, such as drilling, contouring, pocketing, facing, grooving, boring, and more. You can also simulate and verify your toolpaths before generating CNC code. Inventor CAM 2017 supports a wide range of CNC machines, including 3-axis, 4-axis, 5-axis, turning, and mill-turn machines. You can use the powerful post processor system to quickly customize and output CNC code for your specific machine and controller[^1^].
 
## Why Use Inventor CAM 2017?
 
Inventor CAM 2017 offers many benefits for CNC programmers and machinists, such as:
 
- Reduced mill time: You can use the Adaptive Clearing strategy as a roughing technique for efficiently removing a high volume of material while minimizing tool and machine wear. This strategy maintains a constant load on the tool throughout the machining cycle, allowing you to cut deep without risk of breakage[^1^].
- Increased tool life: By using the Adaptive Clearing strategy, you can also extend the life of your tools by reducing heat and stress on the cutting edges. You can also optimize your toolpaths for smooth transitions and avoid sharp corners and sudden changes in direction[^1^].
- Maintained associativity: You can keep your toolpaths updated automatically as you make changes to your 3D model in Inventor. This ensures that your toolpaths always match your design intent and eliminates the need to reprogram your parts every time you make a modification[^1^].
- Improved quality: You can use the advanced simulation and verification features in Inventor CAM 2017 to check your toolpaths for errors, collisions, gouges, and excess material. You can also compare your machined part with your original model and measure the deviations. This helps you ensure that your part meets your specifications and quality standards[^1^].
